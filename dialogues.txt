[beginning]
I'm here out of nowhere. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I was. I don't know why I'm here. I'm just ... here.
I don't even know my name. I think I can remember. I think I can remember my name. My name is ...
I can't remember.
I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing.

Me: Excuse me. Do you know where this is? I'm kinda lost here.
Librarian: Do I look like a guide to you? I'm a librarian!
Me: Okay, then, I'm looking for a book.
Librarian: What kind of book? I can't show you if you're not being specific.
Me: I—I don't know what I'm looking for.
Librarian: Why did you ask me then?
Librarian: Go away, explore for yourself. Don't bother me again.

I walk into the west hall. I don't know what I'm looking for.
Why did I say I was looking for a book?
I see a book on the table. I should take it.
I look at the book. The title is "... it about, umm, what is ...".
I open the book, it says, "I'm here out of nowhere. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I was."
Wait, I said that before. Is that?
I immediately close the book. I'm scared.
How could it contain exactly what I said earlier?

Me: I'm sorry, but this is urgent. I need to ask you something.
Girl: Ugh, what is it? Better be quick.
Me: Can you tell me where I am? I'm kinda lost in here.
Girl: You're in the ??? city public library.
Me: I'm sorry, what city?
Girl: ??? city.
Me: Is it just me or are you mumbling?

I sit on the bench alone.
Someone's approaching me, and sits on the bench. I should say hello to them.
Me: Hello, can I ask you something?
Someone: Have we had this conversation before?
Me: Not that I could think of. Wait—
Someone: What is it were you gonna ask?
Me: I don't know. I'm just trying to find out.

Me: What city?
Someone: ??? city.
Me: I'm sorry, what city?
Someone: ??? city.
Me: I can't hear you clearly. I'm sorry. I should go.
Someone: Can't you stop being so rude, man?!

Why were they mad at me for no reason?
Maybe I should go somewhere else.
