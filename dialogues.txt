[beginning]
I'm here out of nowhere. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I was. I don't know why I'm here. I'm just ... here.
I don't even know my name. I think I can remember. I think I can remember my name. My name is ...
I can't remember.
I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing.

... [talk]

[talk]
Maybe I should talk to someone.

Go to the library [library]
Go to the park [park]
Go to the house [house]
Go to the school [school]

[library]
I'm in the library. There should be people here.
I see the librarian over there. I should talk to him.
Me: Excuse me. Do you know where this is? I'm kinda lost here.
Librarian: Do I look like a guide to you? I'm a librarian!
Me: Okay, then, I'm looking for a book.
Librarian: What kind of book? I can't show you if you're not being specific.
Me: I—I don't know what I'm looking for.
Librarian: Why did you ask me then?
Librarian: Go away, explore for yourself. Don't bother me again.
Maybe he's right. I should go somewhere else.

Go to the west hall [west hall]
Go to the east hall [east hall]

[west hall]
I walk into the west hall. I don't know what I'm looking for.
Why did I say I was looking for a book?
I see a book on the table. I should take it.
I look at the book. The title is "... it about, umm, what is ...".
I open the book, it says, "I'm here out of nowhere. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I was."
Wait, I said that before. Is that?
I immediately close the book. I'm scared.
How could it contain exactly what I said earlier?

Go back to the main hall [library]
Go to the east hall [east hall]
Go outside [talk]

[continue reading]
I opened the book again, skipping the page I read earlier.
I see an intriguing diagram. I should look at it.
I look at the diagram. It looks like a map, a graph, or something.
Library -> East Hall -> West Hall -> East Hall -> Library -> West Hall
It looks like a loop.
I don't know what it means through.

Go back to the main hall [library]
Go to the east hall [east hall]
Go to the west hall [west hall]
Go outside [talk]

[east hall]
I walk into the east hall. I see a girl sitting down just there.
I approached her, and say hello to her.
Me: Hello, can I ask you something?
Girl: Can't you see I'm reading right now?
Me: I'm sorry, but this is urgent. I need to ask you something.
Girl: Ugh, what is it? Better be quick.
Me: Can you tell me where I am? I'm kinda lost in here.
Girl: You're in the ??? city public library.
Me: I'm sorry, what city?
Girl: ??? city.
Me: Is it just me or are you mumbling?
Girl: Are you saying I can't talk? How dare you insult me like that!
Me: I'm, I'm sorry. I should go.
Why is it that every time I tried to talk to someone,
they are always mad at me?
Maybe I really suck at this.

Go back to the main hall [library]
Go to the west hall [west hall]
Go outside [talk]

[park]
I'm in the park. The weather is nice today.
I should take a walk around the park.
I walk around the park. I see a bunch of people.
I see a bench in the middle of the park. Maybe I should sit down.

Sit on the bench [bench]
Go back [talk]

[bench]
I sit on the bench alone.
Someone's approaching me, and sits on the bench. I should say hello to them.
Me: Hello, can I ask you something?
Someone: Have we had this conversation before?
Me: Not that I could think of. Wait—
Someone: What is it were you gonna ask?
Me: I don't know. I'm just trying to find out.
Someone: Well, I'm just wondering, where are you from?
Me: Where am I from? I can't remember.
Someone: Well, I'm from the ??? city.
Me: What city?
Someone: ??? city.
Me: I'm sorry, what city?
Someone: ??? city.
Me: I can't hear you clearly. I'm sorry. I should go.
Someone: Can't you stop being so rude, man?!
I stand up from the bench and go away.
Why were they mad at me for no reason?
Did I say something wrong?
Maybe I should go somewhere else.

Go back to the main park area [park]
Go somewhere else [talk]

[house]
I'm in front of the house. There's something about this house. I don't know what it is.
I feel like I've been here before. I feel like I've known this place before.
Is this my house? I don't know.
Wait, there's something in my pocket.

Check the pocket [pocket]

[pocket]
I put my hands in my pocket. There's a key inside. I should take it.
I take the key, and use it on the front door.

Go inside the house [inside house]

[inside house]
I go inside the house. There's someone inside. I should talk to her.
???: You're finnaly home. Where were you these days?
Me: I also don't know where I was. Who are you?
???: Who am I? Are you trying to troll me? Do you really don't know who I am?
Me: I don't know. I don't know.
???: What does that even mean? I raised you. How could you forget?
Me: Are you supposed to be my mother or something?
???: I'm your mom, you idiot! I'm your mom!
Me: Mom?
Mom: What else, you dumbass? Of course I am!

... [house choice]

[house choice]
Me: I'm sorry.
Me: I'm confused.
Me: I think I should go.
Mom: Where the **** you think you're going?! Come back here!

Go outside the house [outside from house]
Stay inside [stay inside house]

[stay inside house]
I stay inside the house.

... [house choice]

[outside from house]
I go outside the house. I think that was wrong. I don't know what to do.

... [talk]

[school]
I'm in the school area.
There are kids playing on the field.
Or maybe I could also go inside, talk to the receptionist.

Go to the receptionist [receptionist]
Go to the field [field]

[field]
I should go to the playground.
I walk to the playground.
I see a kid playing on the field. I should talk to him.
Me: Hey, kid, are we in a loop?
Kid: What loop are you talking about?
Me: I don't know. I'm just trying to find out.
Kid: Well, I'm gonna put this ball in a loop if you would SHUT UP!
Me: I'm sorry. I should go.
It feels like everything I do is wrong.

Go back to the main school area [school]
Go to the receptionist [receptionist]
Go somewhere else [talk]

[receptionist]
I walk to the main building. I see a receptionist. I should talk to her.
Me: Hello, can I ask you something?
Receptionist: What is it you want?
Me: Do you have any idea what this is, where am I, why am I here?
Receptionist: What in the world are you talking about?
Me: I don't know. I'm just trying to find out.
Receptionist: If you're just gonna waste my time, why don't you go away?
Me: Have we had this conversation before?
Receptionist: Are you crazy or something?
Me: Are we in a loop?
Receptionist: What loop are you talking about?
Me: I don't know. I'm just trying to find out.
Receptionist: I'm not a detective. I'm just a receptionist.
Receptionist: So, if you please, kindly GO AWAY FROM HERE YOU CRAZY!
Me: I'm sorry. I should go.
I really am a failure.
I don't know anything.

[secret]
Wait why is there a door here? It wasn't there before.
Weird, maybe I should go in there. I should check it out.
I open the door. Huh, it's not locked.
I walk in. There's no one inside.
I can only see a desk and a chair with a lot of books surrounding the room.
I closed the door, and stayed inside.
When I look back, I see someone sitting on the chair.
She wasn't there before.
Me: I'm sorry to bother you. I didn't know you were here.
???: What is it are you doing here?
Me: I saw a door that I believe it wasn't there before.
Me: So I go right through in to see what's inside.
???: How did you get in here? How did you find this place?
Me: I, I saw a diagram. I followed it and saw the door.
Me: I'm sorry. I should go.
???: Wait, don't go yet.
Me: What is it?
???: I know the answer to your questions.
Me: Really? Do you know where I am then? Why am I here?
???: I'm afraid I can't tell you the answer.
Me: But you said you know it.
???: It is true that I know the answer, but I just can't tell you.
Me: Excuse me?
???: Time's up. You should go now.
I promptly exit the room because I'm afraid of what she might do to me. 
When she said that she knows the answer, I was excited.
Finnaly, I would know the truth.
But then, she said that she can't tell me the answer.
Maybe I put too much expectation on her.
Maybe I'm dissapointed in her because she didn't tell me.
But I can't be pissed at her. 
It feels wrong to feel disappointed with others
because the disappointment comes from within.
I created the disappointment myself.
She has nothing to do with this.
I'm responsible for my own feelings.
Maybe I should go somewhere else.

Go back to the main library area [library]

[long]
Hmm...
How long have I been here?
I've been here for too long.
It's like I'm on a loop.
Waiting, waiting, waiting.
Waiting for answers hopelessly.
Is this worth waiting for?
Or maybe should I just stop doing this?
I've been mindlessly wandering around,
talking to people, yet I seem to annoy them a lot.
Did I do something wrong?
I guess I wasn't meant to do all of that.
I'm just a complete failure.
I can't fulfill their expectations.
Why am I here then?
What is my purpose here?
If I'm just gonna go back to them again,
go back all over again,
talking to them, and getting back the same answers,
then why am I here?
Or maybe I just need to accept my fate.
I am here,
and will always be here,
until I decide to stop.
And until that time comes,
I accept my futile existence.
